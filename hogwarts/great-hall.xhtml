    This is the Great Hall of Hogwarts. It is the central point of the castle where students learn witchcraft and wizardry. <br/>
  	At the start of each school year, this is where the Sorting Ceremony takes place. Throughout the year, many other ceremonies and festivities take place. <br/>
  	Examples are Halloween Dinner, Christmas Dinner, and several gala events. <br/>
  	During the day, students can visit the Great Hall to do their homework, and during breakfast, lunch and dinner, plates of food and vases of drinks are appearing
  	on the table, which are cleaned after one's finished. Throughout the day, small snacks can be eaten here if paid for them. <br/>
  	The ceiling of the Great hall is enchanted, making the people show the sky outside and making candles float midair for illumination.
  	Rain, snow or hail however cannor fall in. The tables and seats are also enchanted, making them appear or disappear when needed. Because of 
  	this, the Great Hall can be used for many puposes, like a duelling stage, a dancefloor or exam locations.
