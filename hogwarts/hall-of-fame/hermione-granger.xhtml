        Minister Hermione Jean Granger was a Muggle-born witch born to Mr and Mrs Granger, both dentists.
        Hermione was raised as a Muggle girl until, at age eleven, she learned that she was a witch and had been
        accepted into
        Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. She began attending the school on 1 September, 1991, where she was
        subsequently
        sorted into Gryffindor House, despite being considered for Ravenclaw. She possessed a brilliant academic mind,
        and proved to be a
        gifted student in almost every subject that she studied. She was very studious and bookish.

        Hermione first met [[harry-potter|Harry Potter]] and [[ron-weasley|Ron Weasley]] aboard the Hogwarts Express.
        Both boys found Hermione unfriendly
        and
        somewhat of an insufferable know-it-all. Later, her eagerness to please her professors and her constant correct
        answers
        reinforced their initial impression. However, in spite of the cool relationship between the three, Hermione
        stepped in to take the
        blame from Ron and Harry after they had saved her from a troll on Hallowe'en in 1991. Harry and Ron were
        surprised,
        but grateful and the three quickly became friends.

        In her second year, Hermione played a crucial role in the discovery of the Chamber of Secrets, before falling
        victim to the
        basilisk unleashed upon Hogwarts following the opening of the Chamber. She was recovered from her petrification
        under the care of
        Madam Pomfrey with the assistance of Professor Sprout's Mandrake Restorative Draught. The following year,
        Hermione was granted
        permission to use, and was sent, a Time-Turner from the Ministry of Magic to facilitate her volition to study
        far more subjects
        than was possible without time travel. Later in the year, she and Harry would use the Time-Turner to rescue
        Sirius Black from
        the Dementor's Kiss as well as Buckbeak the hippogriff from execution.

        Hermione and Ron both decided not to return to Hogwarts for their final year of studies and instead chose to

        of Hogwarts,
        as well as destroying Hufflepuff's Cup, a horcrux with Ron Weasley, using a basilisk fang found in the Chamber
        of Secrets
        (then opened by Ron imitating Harry saying "open" in Parseltongue).
