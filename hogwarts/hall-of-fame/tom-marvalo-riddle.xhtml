        Tom Marvolo Riddle later and better known as Lord Voldemort, was a half-blood wizard who was considered to have
        been
        the most powerful and dangerous Dark wizard of all time. The son of the wealthy Muggle Tom Riddle Senior and the
        witch Merope Gaunt,
        he was orphaned and raised in a Muggle orphanage, which remained his permanent residence through his 1938-1945
        attendance at
        Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. He was a member of Slytherin house.

        His accomplishments included the opening of Salazar Slytherin's Chamber of Secrets and the use of its monster to
        attack Muggle-born students;
        several months' service as a purchasing agent for the Dark artefacts shop Borgin and Burkes; the ability to
        speak Parseltongue;
        and the attainment of immortality between the years of 1942 and 1998, a process begun upon the creation of his
        first Horcrux at the
        age of 16. Splitting his own spirit into a total of eight fragments, Lord Voldemort created seven Horcruxes; one
        unintentionally and
        without his knowledge - [[harry-potter|Harry Potter]]. Abandoning his 'Muggle' name, he became the self-proclaimed Lord
        Voldemort,
        which was an anagram of his birth name. He commanded a veritable army of wizards and Dark creatures, committed
        numerous murders
        personally and through his followers, and on one occasion nearly succeeded and on a later occasion did succeed
        in taking over
        'the Ministry of Magic by installing a puppet Minister.

        Voldemort was ripped from his body in 1981, after attempting to kill Harry Potter, and though unable to die, was
        not able
        to regain a permanent and physical body until 1995, thus spending the intervening 14 years "a shell, less than
        the meanest ghost",
        but alive. He was finally killed by his own backfiring curse, after Albus Dumbledore, and then Harry Potter
        after Dumbledore's death,
        succeeded in destroying all of his Horcruxes.

        Tom Riddle's broken and mutilated soul was then trapped in Limbo for eternity, unable to move on to the
        afterlife or even return as
        a disembodied spirit.
        Unknown to most however, Lord Voldemort's legacy and blood would live on through his daughter Delphini,
        whom he conceived with his loyal follower Bellatrix Lestrange. Delphini was conceived sometime after the
        Battle of the Department of Mysteries in 1996 and before Voldemort's death at the hands of Harry Potter in 1998.
