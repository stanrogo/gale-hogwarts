        Harry James was a half-blood wizard, the only child and son of the late James and Lily Potter,
        and one of the most famous wizards of modern times. In what proved to be a vain attempt to circumvent a prophecy
        that stated that
        a boy born at the end of July of 1980 could be able to defeat him, Lord Voldemort tried to murder him when he
        was a year and
        three months old. Voldemort murdered Harry's parents as they tried to protect him, shortly before attacking
        Harry.
        This early unsuccessful attempt to vanquish Harry led to Voldemort's first downfall, marking the end of the
        First Wizarding War
        and to Harry henceforth being known as the "Boy Who Lived." One consequence of Lily's loving sacrifice was that
        her orphaned son
        had to be raised by her only remaining blood relative.
        Harry was raised by his Muggle aunt Petunia Dursley, where he would be protected from Lord Voldemort, due to the
        Bond of Blood charm
        Albus Dumbledore placed upon him.
        This powerful charm would protect him until he became of age. As the only known survivor of the Killing Curse
        (up to that point),
        Harry was already famous before he arrived at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.

        On his eleventh birthday Harry learnt that he was a wizard.

            He began attending Hogwarts in 1991 and was Sorted into Gryffindor House.

        While at school, Harry became best friends with Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger.

            and later became the youngest Quidditch Seeker in over a century and eventually the captain of
            his house's team, winning two Quidditch Cups.

        He became even better known in his early years for protecting the Philosopher's Stone from Voldemort,
        saving Ron's sister Ginny Weasley, solving the mystery of the Chamber of Secrets, slaying Salazar Slytherin's
        basilisk, and learning how to conjure a corporeal stag Patronus at the age of thirteen.
        In his fourth year Harry won the Triwizard Tournament, although the competition ended with the tragic
        death of Cedric Diggory and the return of Lord Voldemort. During the next school year,
        Harry reluctantly taught and led Dumbledore's Army. He also fought in the Battle of the Department of Mysteries,
        during which he lost his godfather, Sirius Black.

        Harry played a significant role in many other battles of the Second Wizarding War. He, Ron, and Hermione hunted
        down and destroyed Voldemort's Horcruxes. During the Battle of Hogwarts Harry personally
        saw the deaths of Severus Snape and Fred Weasley,
        and learned that Remus Lupin, Nymphadora Tonks, Colin Creevey, and many others had fallen in battle as well.
        He encountered Voldemort and sacrificed himself, knowing that his doing so was the only way to destroy the
        fragment of Voldemort's soul inside him. In limbo, after Voldemort cursed him in the forest clearing,
        Albus Dumbledore gave Harry advice and background information on the Dark Lord.
        When told he could choose to live or to "move on", Harry chose to live. After he awoke he confronted Voldemort
        and
        defeated him once and for all.

        Harry was also notable for being the only known Master of Death, having united the three Deathly Hallows at the
        mere age of seventeen. After the war, Harry became an Auror and helped to reform and revolutionise the
        Ministry of Magic. At some point he married Ginny Weasley, with whom he had three children: James Sirius
        (named after his father and godfather), Albus Severus (named after Albus Dumbledore and Severus Snape),
        and Lily Luna (named after his mother and Luna Lovegood). He was also named the godfather of Edward Remus Lupin.

            In 2007 Harry was promoted to Head of the Auror Office at the age of 26, and would occasionally deliver
            Defence Against the Dark Arts lectures at Hogwarts. He later went on to be Head of the Department of Magical
            Law
            Enforcement.
