    <p>This is the Great Hall of Hogwarts. It is the central point of the castle where students learn witchcraft and wizardry. <br/>
	At the start of each school year, this is where the Sorting Ceremony takes place. Throughout the year, many other ceremonies and festivities take place. <br/>
	Examples are Halloween Dinner, Christmas Dinner, and several gala events. <br/>
	During the day, students can visit the Great Hall to do their homework, and during breakfast, lunch and dinner, plates of food and vases of drinks are appearing <br/>
	on the table, which are cleaned after one's finished. Throughout the day, small snacks can be eaten here if paid for them. <br/>
	The ceiling of the Great hall is enchanted, making the people show the sky outside and making candles float midair for illumination. <br/>
	Rain, snow or hail however cannor fall in. The tables and seats are also enchanted, making them appear or disappear when needed. Because of <br/>
	this, the Great Hall can be used for many puposes, like a duelling stage, a dancefloor or exam locations.</p>
