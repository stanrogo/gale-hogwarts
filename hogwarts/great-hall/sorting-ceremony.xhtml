    <h1>Welcome!</h1>

    <p>Welcome to the sorting ceremony of Hogwarts School of WitchCraft And Wizardry!</p>

    <p>
        As we are sure that most of you know, the sorting hat determines what house you belong to. Once you are assigned
        a house, your house will be like your family. You will sleep with your house, points will be assigned to each house
        and at the end, each house has the opportunity of winning the house cup!
