    So, it looks like you have received an invitation letter and are now going to
    Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. <strong>Congratulations!</strong>

        Recently, a number of events have happened at hogwarts that may disuade some of those amongst us
        from applying. Notably the dark lord came to power. However we can now assure you that all of our students
        will be in the securest building in the country and can study for their magical education in peace.
