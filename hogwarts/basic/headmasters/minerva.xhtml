        Professor Minerva McGonagall, O.M. (First Class), (b. 4 October, 1935) was a half-blood witch, the only daughter
        of Muggle Robert McGonagall and witch Isobel Ross. She was a registered Animagus who attended Hogwarts School
        of Witchcraft and Wizardry from 1947-1954 and was Sorted into Gryffindor House
        (but it took the sorting hat 5 ½ minutes to decide if she was Gryffindor or Ravenclaw, therefore making her a
        hatstall).
        After her education, she worked for two years at the Ministry of Magic and later returned to Hogwarts,
        where she became Head of Gryffindor House, Transfiguration professor and concurrently, at differing times,
        Deputy Headmistress and Headmistress of Hogwarts.

        McGonagall was also a member of the Order of the Phoenix. In 1995, she opposed Dolores Umbridge,
        the High Inquisitor of Hogwarts. She also protected the students from Alecto and Amycus Carrow from 1997 until
        1998, and as part of this resistance movement, fought in several battles of both wars, including
        the Battle of the Astronomy Tower and the Battle of Hogwarts (where she led the resistance against Lord
        Voldemort).


        She survived the Second Wizarding War and continued her job as Headmistress, a title she still holds
        as of Albus Potter's time at Hogwarts. During your stay at Hogwarts School, she will therefore also be your
        headmaster. Despite her current standing, she still likes to offer lessons in transfiguration to her students.
