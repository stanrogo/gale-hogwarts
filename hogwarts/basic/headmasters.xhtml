            There have been many headmasters during the course of history of hogwarts school.
            In this hall of fame, we feature those that you are likely to hear other students talk about during
            your studies at our prestigious school. We admire our history of providing students with
            a solid backing in the form of highly knowledgeable and powerful individuals whom we are
            proud to have amongst us.
