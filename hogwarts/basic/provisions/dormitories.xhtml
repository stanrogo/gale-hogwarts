        The dormitories at hogwarts are where you will spend a lot of your free time while at Hogwarts School.
        The dormitories provide four poster beds, a communal living room with an open fire, as well as places to either
        relax, or do some studying in the company of your fellow students.

        <h2>Slytherin Dormitories</h2>

        <p>
            The Slytherin dormitories are located down in the atmospheric dungeon inside Hogwarts School.
            In general, it sports several shades of green and the mantle is adorned with a portrait of a serpent
            (all associated with the house).

            The password to the common room changes every fortnight, and it is posted on the noticeboard. You will have
            to remember this and stay up to date if you fancy sleeping in your bed!
            Slytherin students are warned never to bring students from other houses into the common room,
            or to reveal the password. At slytherin house we pride ourselves that no outsider has entered the common room
            for more than seven centuries.

        <h2>Gryffindor Dormitories</h2>

        <p>
            The Gryffindor Dormitory is located inside the Gryffindor Tower and is where the Gryffindor
            students go to sleep at night. Every dorm room is equipped with a centrally-located stove and each student
            gets their own four poster bed, flanked by a set of windows and space for storing personal belongings.
            On the window sill, a water jug is placed, in case any of the students should
            feel the need for a drink in the middle of the night.

            <strong>Fun fact</strong>: In Albus Dumbledore's fourth year at Hogwarts,
            he set fire to the curtains in this dormitory: whether this was accidental or intentional is uncertain.
            He claimed it was accidental, though he also stated that he hated them, so this statement is questionable
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Fun fact</strong>: Although boys cannot enter the girls' dormitory,
            the opposite doesn't hold true: girls have access to the boy's dormitories. WE won't reveal why this is done.
