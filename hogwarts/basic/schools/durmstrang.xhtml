        The Durmstrang Institute (Cyrillic: Дурмстранг) is the Scandinavian wizarding school,
        located in the northernmost regions of either Norway or Sweden. The school, which presumably takes mainly
        northern European students, is willing to accept international students as far afield as Bulgaria.
        Durmstrang is one of the three schools that compete in the Triwizard Tournament.
        It is an old school, having existed since at least 1294, and is notorious for teaching the Dark Arts.

    <blockquote>
        "Durmstrang is a school for young witches and wizards.
        The school has a dubious reputation, and is known to put a lot of emphasis on teaching the Dark Arts."

        Durmstrang does not admit Muggle-borns. However, it is shown that the students may not necessarily share this
        idea, as Krum attended the Yule Ball with Hermione Granger, who is Muggle-born and would not have been admitted
        at his school.
