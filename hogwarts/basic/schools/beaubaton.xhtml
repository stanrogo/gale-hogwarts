    <p>
        Beauxbatons Academy of Magic (French: Académie de Magie Beauxbâtons) is the French wizarding school,
        located in the Pyrenees in southern France. The school takes at least a plurality of its students
        from France, but also takes them in large numbers from Belgium, Luxembourg,
        the Netherlands, Portugal, and Spain. It's unknown if students from other countries are allowed.
        The school coat of arms is two golden wands crossed over one another, each shooting three stars.

        "Thought to be situated somewhere in the Pyrenees, visitors speak of the breath-taking beauty of a chateau
        surrounded by formal gardens and lawns created out of the mountainous landscape by magic."
