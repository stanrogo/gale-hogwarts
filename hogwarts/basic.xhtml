        Recently, a number of events have happened at hogwarts that may disuade some of those amongst us
        from applying. Notably the dark lord came to power. However we can now assure you that all of our students
        will be in the securest building in the country and can study for their magical education in peace. This also
        comes from our pride in our [[basic/headmasters|headmasters]] of now and former who had and do enjoy to this
        day an excellent reputation around the world.

    <h2>
        A History
    </h2>
    <gale:text tag="default" type="creole">
        Howgwarts School is established inside a castle located in the mountains near a loch.
        The precise location of the school can never be uncovered because it was rendered Unplottable, so we advise
        students not to try to find this information out for themselves.
        To Muggles the school looks like an old abandoned castle, in the same way that the
        [[basic/schools| other wizarding schools]]
        protect their grounds to prevent our ways of teaching being revealed,
        as well as protect the students and schools themselves from any harm.

    <p>
        Established around the 10th century, Hogwarts is considered to be one of the finest magical institutions in
        the wizarding world, though other notable schools included Beauxbatons Academy of Magic and
        the Durmstrang Institute. Our motto is Draco Dormiens Nunquam Titillandus, which, translated from Latin,
        means "Never tickle a sleeping dragon".
