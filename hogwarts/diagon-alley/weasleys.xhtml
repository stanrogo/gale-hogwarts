	<body>
		<p>Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes, also known as Weasley & Weasley, is a joke shop located at Number 93 Diagon Alley founded by <br/>
		Fred and George Weasley.<br/>
		<br/>
		The shop contains practical joke objects, such as Extendable Ears, a Reusable Hangman, Skiving Snackboxes, <br/>
		and Fred and George's special WonderWitch products, such as; Love Potions, Ten-Second Pimple Vanishers, and  Pygmy Puffs. <br/>
		There is also a section of Muggle Magic Tricks "for freaks like Dad"[HP6], which are said to do steady business, <br/>
		despite not being big sellers. The shop also sells a number of defensive magical objects. This establishment started <br/>
		out as an 'owl-post service' led by the twins from the Burrow, (later continued from Hogwarts), selling joke-products until<br/>
		the final shop was opened.<br/>
		<br/>
		The shop was the Weasley twins' dream. However, they had a few things holding them back. Their mother, <br/>
		Molly Weasley, attempted to force them through their 7th and final year at Hogwarts, but they boiled over during Umbridge's <br/>
		time at Hogwarts and dramatically flew away on broom sticks. The money for the shop was donated to them from Harry Potter, <br/>
		who gave them his Triwizard Tournament prize of 1,000 Galleons. </p>
