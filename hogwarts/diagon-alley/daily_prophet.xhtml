		<p>The Daily Prophet is a wizarding newspaper based in London. It is the primary source of news for British wizards. <br/>
		The current editor is Barnabas Cuffe, who works in the main office in Diagon Alley. <br/>
		Because of its ability to influence the minds of many in the British (and probably Irish) wizarding community, <br/>
		the paper has been known to have its content slanted intentionally by the Ministry of Magic (which it has strong ties with)<br/>
		into telling the Ministry's preferred version of events. Unfortunately, the Prophet does not seem to have a lot of journalistic integrity,<br/>
		it has been known to be more concerned about sales than about factual accuracy.<br/>
		<br/>
		The paper features a morning and evening edition, the latter of which is called the Evening Prophet. <br/>
		The weekend edition is called the Sunday Prophet. Additional news bulletins can be delivered quickly when important, <br/>
		newsworthy events occur. As news changes, an edition may magically change, too, over the course of the day, probably by means<br/>
		of a Protean Charm. </p>
