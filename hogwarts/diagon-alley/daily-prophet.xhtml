        The Daily Prophet is a wizarding newspaper based in London. It is the primary source of news for British
        wizards.
        The current editor is Barnabas Cuffe, who works in the main office in Diagon Alley.
        Because of its ability to influence the minds of many in the British (and probably Irish) wizarding community,
        the paper has been known to have its content slanted intentionally by the Ministry of Magic (which it has strong
        ties with) into telling the Ministry's preferred version of events. Unfortunately, the Prophet does not
        seem to have a lot of journalistic integrity, it has been known to be more concerned about sales
        than about factual accuracy.

        The paper features a morning and evening edition, the latter of which is called the Evening Prophet.
        The weekend edition is called the Sunday Prophet. Additional news bulletins can be delivered quickly when
        important, newsworthy events occur. As news changes, an edition may magically change, too, over
        the course of the day, probably by means of a Protean Charm.
