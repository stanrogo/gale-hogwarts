		<p>Gringotts Wizarding Bank is the only bank of the wizarding world, and is owned and operated by goblins. <br/>
		It was created by a goblin called Gringott, in 1474. Its main offices are located around the North Side of Diagon Alley <br/>
		in London, England. In addition to storing money and valuables for wizards and witches, one can go there to exchange Muggle <br/>
		money for wizarding money. The currency exchanged by Muggles is later returned to circulation in the Muggle world by goblins.<br/>
		According to Rubeus Hagrid, other than Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Gringotts is the safest place in the wizarding world.<br/>
		<br/>
		The motto of Gringotts Wizarding Bank is Fortius Quo Fidelius, a Latin phrase that means "Strength through loyalty". </p>
