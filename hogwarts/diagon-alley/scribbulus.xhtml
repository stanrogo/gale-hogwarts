        Scribbulus Writing Implements was a shop in Diagon Alley that sold quills, ink, and parchment.
        It was located next door to Quality Quidditch Supplies, and next to an archway leading into Knockturn
        Alley. In the summer of 1996, the shop was either abandoned or ransacked by Death Eaters. It was also a shop in
        Hogsmeade.
