        The Leaky Cauldron is a popular wizarding pub and inn located in London. It is the entrance to Diagon Alley and
        indirectly Knockturn Alley. The rear of the pub opens up onto a chilly courtyard that contains the
        entrance to both alley ways.

        The pub was built by Daisy Dodderidge, the first landlady, in the early 1500s. She said that it was,
        "to serve as a gateway between the non-wizarding world and Diagon Alley." It had a bar, several private parlour
        rooms, and a large dining room.

        To Muggles, the pub appears to be a broken-down old shop front on Charing Cross Road.
        This, however, was not the case prior to the imposition of the Statute of Secrecy and, in fact, prior to this,
        Muggle visitors were neither turned away, nor made to feel unwelcome.
