    Plant 1: <i>Mandragora, or Mandrake</i>
  </h2>
  <p>
    This plant has a root which has the shape that looks like a baby. The cry of a young mandragora will cause the hearer to faint, where the cry of a mature examplar can be fatal.
    To stop the plant from screaming, it should be earthed. The process of becoming a mature mandragora resembles the aging in humans: mandragors can become moody, secretive, loud and even have acne. <br>
    The leaves of a mandragora are green/bownish and the plant can be used as ingredient in Restorative Draught, to cure petrified creatures.
