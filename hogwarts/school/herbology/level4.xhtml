    Plant 1: <i>Gillyweed</i>
  </h2>
  <p>
    This plant, which is native to the Mediterranean Sea, is a magical seaplant.
    When a wizard or witch consumes this plant, it will grow gills and webbing between te fingers and toes. Through this transformation, the user can breathe underwater. The effects of this plant should last for one hour, but there is debate among herbologists whether salt or fresh water influences this time.
    Gillyweed is said to resemble a bundle of slimy, grey-green rat tails.
