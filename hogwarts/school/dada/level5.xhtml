    Spell 2: <i>Rictusempra</i>
  </h2>
  <p>
    The spell Rictusempra is also a friendly one: it causes the victim to buckle with laughter. This has a positive consequence: it tickels the victim and thus weakens it. <br/>
The light the want should emit is silver and the hand movement can be best described as following an eye from the left corner,along the top to the right and then along the bottom back to the inital place.
  Ther exists a very similar, other spell named 'the Tickling Hex'. It is unknown how they differ but the other spell is presumed to have less desirable effect.</p>
