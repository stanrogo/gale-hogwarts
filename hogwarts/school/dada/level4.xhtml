    Spell 1: <i>Mimble wimble</i>
  </h2>
  <p>
This friendly spell will bind the target's tongue to keep him or her talking about a specific subject. This feature also allows one to prevent the victim from incanting. <br></br>
The light that the wand should emit is blue, and the hand movement can be best described as following the clock from 12 to 3 clockwise, then going up to the number 12 and again follow the 'curve' until you reached the number 7.
