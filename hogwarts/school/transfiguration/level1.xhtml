  <p> This course will teach you how to change the form and appearance of an object. Be careful; due to the nature of this subject, practising Transfiguration might go horribly wrong.
    If this magic is performed inproperly, the object to be transfigured might become half-transfigured or permanently stuck in one state. Within transfiguration, there exist four main branches which students get to know during the course:
    classification, vanishment, conjuration and untransfiguration.

    Information about the Transfiguration course
  </h2>
  <p>
    The subject is obligated for all first year to fifth year students, and can be continued as <abbr title="Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Test">N.E.W.T.</abbr> course in the sixth and seventh year.
    In order to be able to learn the advanced courses in the sixth and seventh year, a student needs to pass his <abbr title="Ordinary Wizarding Level">O.W.L.</abbr> examination.
    Like the Charms course, Transfiguration is achieved through concentration, precize wand movements, and the proper pronounciation of an incantation.
    The intended transformation is directly influenced by: bodyweight, viciousness, wand power, concentration and a fifth unknown variable.
