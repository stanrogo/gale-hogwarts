    Incantation 2: <i>Riddikulus</i>
  </h2>
  <p>
    This spell, also known as the Boggart-Banishing Spell is a spell used in defence against a Boggart.
    A boggart can be defeated by laughter, so the caster transforms the boggart into a humorous form. <br></br>
    The hand movement should be as follows for completing this incantation: the caster should follow the pattern of a full cosine cycle. <br></br>
    There is no light coming out of the wand while performing this incantation. <br></br>
    Sidenote: this charm requires a force of mind to be able to cast it. The boggart will have an initial shape that is fearful to the caster, which might distract the caster from succesfully cast it.
